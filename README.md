# Best way to start earning (only spend $1)

To get a good start in Clash of Streamers without spending a lot of money you need to understand how **sale points** work.

Sale points gives you a discount when you make a purchase using them. 1 sale point gives you a 4% discount so if you have 25 of them you get a **100%** discount (which means you get the deal for **FREE**). 

During the tutorial you get a total of 20 sale points.

Your 20 sale points will give you a 80% discount but you should **NOT** use them yet! Remember that if you have 25 sale points you get 100% which means you potentaly could get a **$100 deal for FREE** 

If you are about to use your sale points you will see the precentage above the button like this

The first thing you want to do is to disable the use of sale points so you don't use them by mistake. You do this by holding down the button untill the percentage disappears and you see the higher price.

# First purchase

To get started you really need to have a total of 25 sale points and since you already have 20 from tutorial you only need to get 5 more. You do this by purchasing the first deal you can find which will give you +5 sale points. 

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you do NOT use your sale points when you purchase this deal, you do not want to waste your 20 sale points! Disable sale points like shown previously so you do not get the 80% discount.

After this purchase you should have enought sale points to get a 100% discount

Now you are going to use 25 sale points to get the Golden Boost for free! You can find this by clicking on the trophy button to the left and one of the "Get more" buttons. Just hold the buy button to activate your sale points again to buy it for free.

This boost gives you a lot of gems, kappa scrolls and strong heroes, which are very important for you to progress in the game AND you also get **25 sale points back!** This means that you can forever renew this boost every month for **FREE**. And don't worry about not finishing all the steps after you have bought the boost, you will still get all the sale points and most of the rewards anyway in the end of the month! And you always want to prestige when you reach the end of the boost (you will understand when you get there).

# After getting the Golden Boost

Now all you do is play the game normaly and get more account levels. Every month remember to buy a new golden boos with the previous 25 sale points, remember to NOT use the sale points for anything other. Only the golden boost! Else you have to buy the golden boost with cash which is like $10 to get 25 new sale points.

**Continue to do this every month until you get close to account level 25.**

# Late game - account level 25+
