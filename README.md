# Best way to start earning (only spending $1)

To get a good start in Clash of Streamers without spending a lot of money you need to understand how **sale points** work. You should also make sure you are in my community since it will earn you more crypton (cause I'm a nice guy that sends crypton to active community members). Search for Ninjabull#5100 ðŸ¥³

Sale points give you a discount when you make a purchase using them. 1 sale point gives you a 4% discount so if you have 25 of them you get a **100%** discount (which means you get the deal for **FREE**). 

During the tutorial you get a total of 20 sale points.

Your 20 sale points will give you a 80% discount but you should **NOT** use them yet! Remember that if you have 25 sale points you get 100% which means you potentially could get a **$100 deal for FREE** 

If you are about to use your sale points you will see the percentage above the button like this

The first thing you want to do is to disable the use of sale points so you don't use them by mistake. You do this by holding down the button until the percentage disappears and you see the higher price.

# First purchase

To get started you really need to have a total of 25 sale points and since you already have 20 from the tutorial you only need to get 5 more. You do this by purchasing the first deal you can find which will give you +5 sale points. This will cost you about $1 in your local currency, in my example images this is Swedish crowns.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you do NOT use your sale points when you purchase this deal, you do not want to waste your 20 sale points! Disable sale points like shown previously so you do not get the 80% discount.

After this purchase you should have enough sale points (25) to get a 100% discount

Now you are going to use 25 sale points to get the Golden Battle Pass for free! You can find this by clicking on the trophy button to the left and one of the "Get more" buttons. Just hold the buy button to activate your sale points again to buy it for free.

This boost gives you a lot of gems, kappa scrolls and strong heroes, which are very important for you to progress in the game AND you also get **25 sale points back!** This means that you can forever renew this boost every month for **FREE**. And don't worry about not finishing all the steps after you have bought the boost, you will still get all the sale points and most of the rewards anyway at the end of the month! And you always want to prestige when you reach the end of the boost (you will understand when you get there).

# After getting the Golden Battle Pass

Now all you do is play the game normally and get more account levels. Every month remember to buy a new Golden Battle Pass with the previous 25 sale points, remember to NOT use the sale points for anything else. Only the Golden Battle Pass! Else you have to buy the Golden Battle Pass with cash which is like $10 to get 25 new sale points.

**Continue to do this every month until you get close to account level 25. Then you can proceed with the next part**

# Late game - account level 25+

Here is where you start making the money!

In the game there are 5 different insanity boosts which all give you an extra resource AND +1 sale point for **every** account level. These have to be bought in a specific order so you can only see one of them at a time in the shop.

The easiest way to find this boost is to look at the top deals in our community and look for a boost close to the top with a name starting with "Insanity". The first one you can buy is "Insanity Gem Boost". To switch to the community list, just click on the head to the right and make sure you have "Deals" in the bottom right corner.

Since the boost gives you +1 sale point per level you will instantly get your 25 sale points back after you buy it for free using 25 sale points when you are at account level 25. This means that you can instantly buy all the other insanity boosts also and still have 25 sale points in the end that you can use to renew your Golden Boost.

The 5 insanity boosts are the following:

Gem

Kappa

Mega

PogChamp

Madness

When you have all 5 you will get 1 of each resource, 1 million gems and **5 sale points** every time your account level goes up.

![claim](/docs/assets/images/claim.gif)

This means that now you will have an extra 25 sale points every 5 account levels which you can use for a free purchase!

Depending on how much you play you can probably get at least one free purchase every month.

Use the sale points on the most expensive deal you can find that gives you the most crypton. Or maybe do what I usually do which is using them to buying an exclusive skin every now and then that sell for thousands of crypton on the auction house.

But remember to always have 25 sale points left at the end of the month so you can keep getting the Golden Boost for free so you keep making faster progress!
