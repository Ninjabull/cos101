# CoS-101

To get a good start in Clash of Streamers without spending a lot of money you need to understand how **sale points** work.

Sale points gives you a discount when you make a purchase using them. 1 sale point gives you a 4% discount so if you have 25 of them you get a **100%** discount (which means you get the deal for **FREE**). 

During the tutorial you get a total of 20 sale points.

Your 20 sale points will give you a 80% discount but you should **NOT** use them yet! Remember that if you have 25 sale points you get 100% which means you potentaly could get a **$100 deal for FREE** 

If you are about to use your sale points you will see the precentage above the button like this
